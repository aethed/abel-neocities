              >I lied to you when I said I'd never been to a concert before. The
              truth is I was at a gig at least once a week, drums and guitar and
              bass blasting in my face -- my ears still ring from them half a
              decade later. Each Sabbath I&rsquo;d stand right at the front of
              the stage like a lapdog, trying to listen for the truth behind the
              frequency. All the parading, ceremony, spectacle, I wanted it to
              enter me and take me in. The frenzy was everywhere but I was
              missing out. Screaming ladies, this howling that would shatter the
              Sistine Chapel. I tried so damn hard to be a groupie, tried my
              real damn best to keep up with every new tour date, field trip,
              missionary expedition, -- but I was never invited. I kept putting
              myself out there, just like what all the songs and hymns and
              prayers were telling us to do. I saw my siblings get taken up,
              whisked away under the water one by one. Their feet scrubbed
              clean. But I could never hear anything back. Each Sabbath, just
              eight empty crochets for every bar.</span

              >Last summer I went home. I had visions of Amos shepherding and
              twelve men drunk on wine in Samaria that compelled me to look
              again. The old seat on my bike was too small for me now, and its
              chains were rusting over rust. I creaked five miles to home, and I
              was welcomed in Jacob with open arms. But there was this hole
              behind their eyes. In their embrace I learned shame. Those eight
              crochets rang high in the air as they always had: the drums and
              guitar and bass screaming out to us, all the ladies howling back.
              And everyone greeted each other like they had just met for the
              first time. And it was so crowded, but I couldn&rsquo;t see Him
              anywhere, and my chest sunk into itself.&nbsp; And I wept to
              myself because I wanted so bad to see, but I could only listen,
              and it was all so empty.&nbsp;</span
