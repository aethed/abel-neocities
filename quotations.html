Your &ldquo;heart&rdquo;? &hellip; What about me??!! What about me, Jesus?! Huh?! You just, you just&mdash;I made a mistake! And if that was wrong, then you should have told me! And if a broken heart wasn&rsquo;t sufficient reason to hang, THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT, TOO! <br>JESUS: Don&rsquo;t you think &hellip; that if I knew that it would have changed your mind &hellip; that I would have?&rdquo;</div>
